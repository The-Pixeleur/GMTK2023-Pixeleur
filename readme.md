## 🌟 Overview

Valor Sold is a game developed for the GMTK GameJam 2023. The theme of the game jam was "role reversed," and our project reimagines the classic fantasy RPG scenario. Instead of playing as the heroic knight, players take on the role of the vendor, betting on the knight's chance of survival with the weapons they sell.

## 🎮 Game Description

In Valor Sold, you'll step into the shoes of the vendor in a fantasy world. Your goal is to sell weapons and equipment to brave knights heading into perilous adventures. The twist is that you're not just a vendor; you're also a bettor. You must carefully assess the knight's skills and the weapons you offer to make a bet on their chances of survival. It's a unique and thrilling combination of vendor management and betting strategy.
